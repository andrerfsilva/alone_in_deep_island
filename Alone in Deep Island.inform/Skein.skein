Alone in Deep Island
An Interactive Fiction by IM/EBA Alliance of Game Masters
Release 1 / Serial number 130628 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Carla&apos;s Cell
This is the room you&apos;ve been kept since you arrived in this cursed place. Here you witnessed the suffering and despair of many subjects. Yesterday a poor girl was so cruelly abused that she died. Whenever an experience like that fails these guards start patrolling more often. It seems they are observing how you behave. 

This cell is so dirty. It looks like a prison. It even smells like a prison. An uncomfortable iron bed is on the corner of the room. There is also a window on the east wall. You can see the other cells through it.

A barred door leads southeast to the prison hall.

Through the barred door you can see a keeper sleeping noisily outside. He is sitting on a chair on the corner of the prison hall. An iron key hanging on his belt catches your eyes.

Prison Hall
A barred door leads southeast to the prison hall.

An old wooden table is on the corner. So old and rot that you can even see the trails of termite.

You can also see a heavy iron door, a rusty barred door, a wooden char and the keeper here.
