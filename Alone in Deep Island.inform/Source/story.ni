A person has a posture. The posture of a person is usually standing.
A supporter has a posture. A container has a posture.
Posture-permission relates various things to various postures. The verb to allow (it allows, they allow, it allowed, it is allowed) implies the posture-permission relation.
Understand the commands "stand" and "sit" and "lie" as something new.

Understand "stand on/in [something]" as standing up on.

Carry out an actor sitting on:

		if the actor is not seated, try the actor taking position seated; 
		otherwise follow the report taking position rules.

		otherwise follow the report taking position rules.

Understand "stand" or "stand up" as standing up.

	try the actor taking position seated; rule succeeds. 
Instead of an actor standing up: 
	try the actor taking position standing; rule succeeds.
Check an actor taking position: 
	if the holder of the actor is not a room and the holder of the actor does not allow the posture understood: 
		if the actor is the player: 
			say "You can't take that position [in-on the holder of the actor]."; 
		otherwise if the actor is visible: 
			say "[The actor] can't take that position."; 
		stop the action.
Check an actor taking position: 
	if the posture understood is the posture of the actor: 
		if the actor is the player: 
			say "You are already [the posture understood]."; 
		otherwise: 
			if the actor is visible, say "[The actor] is already [the posture understood]."; 
		stop the action.
Carry out an actor taking position: 
	now the posture of the actor is the posture understood.
Report someone taking position (this is the position-report rule): 
	say "[The actor] is now [the posture of the actor][if the holder of the actor is not the location of the actor] [in-on the holder of the actor][end if]."
Report taking position: 
	say "You are now [the posture of the player][if the holder of the player is not the location] [in-on the holder of the player][end if]."
To say in-on (item - a thing): 
	if the item is a container, say "in [the item]"; 
	otherwise say "on [the item]".
Carry out an actor exiting (this is the departure-posture rule): 
	let N be the holder of the actor; 
	if N is a container or N is a supporter, 
		now the posture of the actor is the posture of N; 
	otherwise now the posture of the actor is standing.
The departure-posture rule is listed after the standard exiting rule in the carry out exiting rulebook. 
The departure-posture rule is listed after the standard getting off rule in the carry out getting off rulebook.
Carry out an actor entering something (this is the arrival-posture rule): 
	if the noun is a container or the noun is a supporter, 
		now the posture of the actor is the posture of the noun.
The arrival-posture rule is listed after the standard entering rule in the carry out entering rulebook.
Check an actor going somewhere: 
	if the actor is in a room and the actor is not standing: 
		say "([if the actor is not the player][the actor] [end if]first standing up)[command clarification break]"; 
		silently try the actor taking position standing; 
		if the actor is not standing, stop the action.
